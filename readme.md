# Machine Learning Examples

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various machine learning concepts and techniques, including:

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forests
- Neural Networks
- K-Means Clustering
- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Credit

These scripts were created as part of the coursework for the Machine Learning & AI Micro Boot Camp at Arizona State University (2023). They serve as educational examples and demonstrations of machine learning concepts.

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for a list of Python dependencies. Install using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contents

- SVM examples for classification
- Random Forest implementations with resampling techniques
- Neural Network examples for binary and multiclass classification
- Clustering examples using K-means
- Regression examples (both linear and logistic)
- Decision tree implementations with visualization
- PCA for dimensionality reduction

## Usage

Each script can be run independently and includes comments explaining the concepts and implementation details. Make sure to have all required dependencies installed before running the scripts.
