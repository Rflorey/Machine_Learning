# Machine Learning Clustering Analysis Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various clustering analysis techniques, including K-means clustering, PCA, and data preprocessing. These scripts were developed as part of the Machine Learning & AI Micro Boot Camp at Arizona State University (2023).

## Scripts Overview

- `simple_clustering_class.py`: A class-based implementation for performing clustering analysis with preprocessing capabilities
- `K_means_example.py`: Demonstrates basic K-means clustering with shopping data
- `best_K_means_example.py`: Shows how to determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
- `segmenting_pca_example.py`: Implements PCA with K-means clustering
- `standard_scaler_example.py`: Examples of data standardization techniques

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each script can be run independently. For example:

```python
python simple_clustering_class.py
```

## Features

- Data preprocessing and standardization
- K-means clustering implementation
- PCA dimensionality reduction
- Elbow method for optimal cluster selection
- Visualization tools for cluster analysis

## Credit

These scripts were developed as part of coursework from the Machine Learning & AI Micro Boot Camp at Arizona State University (2023).

## Requirements
