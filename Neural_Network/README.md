# Neural Network Examples

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various neural network implementations using TensorFlow/Keras. These scripts were created as part of the Machine Learning & AI Micro Boot Camp at Arizona State University (2023).

## Scripts Overview

- `nn_cc_defaults_example.py`: Predicts credit card defaults using a neural network
- `nn_general_prediction.py`: Demonstrates basic neural network prediction using generated data
- `nn_myopia_example.py`: Predicts myopia using a deep learning model
- `deep_learning_nn_example.py`: Wine quality prediction using deep neural networks with multiple architectures

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for a complete list of dependencies. The main libraries used are:
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Usage

Each script can be run independently. Make sure to have all required dependencies installed and the necessary data files in the correct locations.

## Credit

These scripts are the result of coursework from the Machine Learning & AI Micro Boot Camp at Arizona State University (2023). They are intended for educational purposes and demonstrate various neural network implementations and techniques.
